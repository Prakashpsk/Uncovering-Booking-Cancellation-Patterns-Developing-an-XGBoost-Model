# Uncovering-Booking-Cancellation-Patterns-Developing-an-XGBoost-Model

# Introduction
Hotel bookings are a crucial aspect of the hospitality industry. Understanding the factors that influence booking cancellations and peak booking times can greatly benefit hotel management in optimizing their operations. In this project, we aim to build an XGBoost model to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not based on various features.

## Skills/Concepts Developed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling categorical data
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance visualization

# Problem Statement
The dataset consists of hotel booking records between July 2015 and August 2017, including bookings that were canceled. The objective is to predict whether a booking will be canceled or not based on features such as lead time, arrival date, number of guests, meal type, market segment, and more.

# Modeling
## Steps
1. Read the hotel dataset.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check data quality, handle missing values, etc.
3. Analyze categorical data and transform using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. Analyze numerical data and transform using power transform.
5. Scale the data.
6. Split the data into a training and test set.
7. Apply the XGBoost model.
8. Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as ROC AUC and accuracy.
9. Visualize feature importances.

# Visualization
- Plot feature importances to understand which features contribute most to predicting booking cancellations.

# Conclusion
Through this project, we have successfully built an XGBoost model to predict hotel booking cancellations. By analyzing factors such as lead time, arrival date, and customer characteristics, hotel management can better understand booking patterns and optimize their operations accordingly.

# Recommendations
- Use the model predictions to allocate resources more effectively during peak booking times.
- Implement targeted marketing strategies to reduce booking cancellations based on customer segments.
- Continuously monitor and update the model to adapt to changing booking patterns.

# How to Use
1. Clone the GitHub repository containing the code.
2. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
